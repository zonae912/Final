## Golden Prompt #1: Comprehensive Project Scaffolding

### Prompt
```
Build all requirements for Campus Resource Hub capstone project:

Core Requirements:
- User authentication with role-based access (student, staff, admin) using Flask-Login and bcrypt
- Resource CRUD with categories, images, availability rules, lifecycle management
- Search and filter with sorting options
- Booking system with calendar integration, conflict detection, approval workflows
- Messaging threads between users
- Reviews and ratings with aggregate calculations
- Admin dashboard for user/resource/booking management

Advanced Features:
- Google Custom Search API integration for enhanced resource discovery
- Google Calendar OAuth integration for calendar sync
- iCal export functionality

Technical Stack:
- Flask with MVC architecture (controllers, models, views, data_access)
- SQLite with proper schema (users, resources, bookings, messages, reviews, admin_logs)
- Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5
- pytest for testing
- Security: CSRF protection, XSS prevention, input sanitization

AI-First Requirements:
- .prompt/ folder with dev_notes.md and golden_prompts.md
- docs/context/ with APA, DT, PM subfolders
- AI-powered Resource Concierge using MCP for database queries
- Clear AI attribution in code comments

Deliverables:
- PRD (1-2 pages)
- Wireframes
- ER diagram
- Complete working application
- Test suite
- Comprehensive documentation
```

## Prompt Engineering Learnings

### Effective Strategies
1. **Context Loading**: Always include relevant sections from project brief
2. **Specificity**: Explicitly list all requirements and constraints
3. **Structure**: Organize prompts with clear sections and bullet points
4. **Validation**: Request specific output formats and quality checks

### Patterns to Avoid
- Vague requests without technical details
- Missing security or architectural constraints
- Forgetting to specify testing requirements
- Omitting documentation expectations

### Refinement Techniques
- Start broad, then iterate with specific corrections
- Reference previous outputs for consistency
- Ask for explanations alongside code
- Request multiple alternatives when uncertain
